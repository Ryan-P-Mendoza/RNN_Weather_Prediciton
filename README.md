# Predicting the weather using Recurrent Neural Networks

Abstractâ€” This report documents our creation of a recurrent neural network using long short-term memory cells with the goal of accurately predicting the temperature, humidity, and pressure for the following day. Using a total of 43,487 entries recorded across the last ten years, (1993-2023) our dataset contains data on daily temperature, precipitation, humidity, and pressure in Dallas, Texas. This project was done in Python, with all primary methods and algorithms coded without the use of libraries. All libraries utilized were used solely for the purpose of pre-processing the dataset and analyzing the final data.
